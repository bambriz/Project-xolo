## Quick Start (Recommended)
1. Double-click `start_game.bat` to start the game
2. The batch file will automatically install Python dependencies if needed
3. Use WASD to move, left-click to attack, right-click for spells!

## Manual Setup (If batch file doesn't work)
1. Install Python from https://python.org/downloads/
   - Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
2. Double-click `install_dependencies.py` to install game requirements
3. Double-click `start_game.bat` to run the game

## Game Controls
- **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**: Move your character
- **Left Click**: Melee attack with equipped weapon
- **Right Click**: Cast equipped spell or ability
- **ESC**: Quit the game

## Gameplay
- Explore procedurally generated dungeons
- Defeat enemies to gain XP and level up
- Collect weapons, enchantments, and spells
- Fight bosses and progress through levels
- Use line-of-sight fog of war for tactical gameplay

## Features
- **Combat System**: Melee weapons and magical spells
- **Item System**: Weapons (sword, mace, spear), enchantments, and spells
- **Enemy Variety**: Multiple enemy types with unique AI behaviors
- **Boss Battles**: Challenging boss fights with special abilities
- **Progression**: Level up system with increasing difficulty
- **Visual Effects**: Damage numbers, weapon rendering, and visual feedback

## Troubleshooting
- If the game doesn't start, make sure Python is installed
- If you get import errors, run `install_dependencies.py`
- For performance issues, close other programs while playing
- If the window appears off-screen, press Alt+Tab to switch to it

## System Requirements
- Windows 7 or newer
- Python 3.7+ (will be prompted to install if missing)
- At least 100MB free disk space
- 1GB RAM recommended

## Support
This is a standalone game. All files needed to run are included in this folder.
The game will automatically handle dependency installation on first run.

Enjoy playing! üéÆ
